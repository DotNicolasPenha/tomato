This project is experimental

the idea is to create applications declaring only JSONs. Furthermore, it's possible to use distributions to add more functionality to your development.

Distributions are like plugins an example is 'tapi', which comes pre-installed and provides advanced folder routing and renders JSON file properties to HTTP.

(see the example folder to see how it works or go to the ["getting started"](./docs/getting_started.md) file)
